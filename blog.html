    <h3>Assignment 1 <em> 4/7/2018</em></h3>
    <p>This week, we had to learn how to make a basic webpage containing information about myself and some of my past experiences.
        We had to learn how the basics of HTML and making use of repositories through Github and Git itself. The biggest issue I 
        ran into while trying to complete this assignment was figuring out how to copy and push repositories from git which I was
        able to figure out by making use of the provided resources from the reading which helped me setup Git. I had known about some
        of the Git functions in the past but have never made use of the service. I also had no real knowledge of html coding but this 
        assignment help serve as a useful starting point for learning the ropes. The most useful resources for me were the Git tutorials
        linked in the assignment as well as the recommended reading from the class website. Another book I made use of was Sketching with CSS
        which also helped me learn more about git commands as well as understanding branches.
