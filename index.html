    <li><em>Confidence in web design skills: </em>0</li>
    <li><em></em>What I hope to learn from this class:</li>
      <p> I hope to expand my knowldege of different computer languages and learn more about the field of web design. 
          At the moment, I am pretty unsure of which field of computer science I would like to go into and would like to
          experience as much as I can.

     <li><em>My most unique experience: </em></li>
      <p> One of my most unique experiences was when I was studying abroad in Japan and I was taking part in a boat tour 
          (despite my aversion to waterborne transport). This tour provided bread to feed to seagulls which would swarm the 
          boat on every tour, and would catch the bread in their mouths. Apparently, the hawks also got the message about 
          free food and would swarm the boat and would compete with the seagulls for the food. The hawks would catch food 
          with their talons and bring it up to their mouth to eat, which overall was an interesting experience.
